/**
 * WordPress API for creating bbcode like tags or what WordPress calls
 * "shortcodes." The tag and attribute parsing or regular expression code is
 * based on the Textpattern tag parser.
 *
 * A few examples are below:
 *
 * [shortcode /]
 * [shortcode foo="bar" baz="bing" /]
 * [shortcode foo="bar"]content[/shortcode]
 *
 * Shortcode tags support attributes and enclosed content, but does not entirely
 * support inline shortcodes in other shortcodes. You will have to call the
 * shortcode parser in your function to account for that.
 *
 * {@internal
 * Please be aware that the above note was made during the beta of WordPress 2.6
 * and in the future may not be accurate. Please update the note when it is no
 * longer the case.}}
 *
 * To apply shortcode tags to content:
 *
 * <code>
 * $out = do_shortcode($content);
 * </code>
